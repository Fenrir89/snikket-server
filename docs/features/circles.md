## What are Snikket circles?

When you invite people to your Snikket instance, you can organize them into
groups we call 'circles'.

Circles have the following features:

- All members within a circle will automatically have everyone else in the
  same circle on their contact list, with no need to add contacts manually.
- Every circle has an automatic group chat created with all the circle members
  in it.
- One person can be a member of multiple circles.

For example, Ruby Lightfoot run a Snikket instance for her family. All Ruby's
family members are in a circle called 'Family' which she created. Ruby also
organizes a weekly board game meetup, and wants to invite her group of friends
to use Snikket, but she doesn't want them all appearing on the contact lists
of her family members. In the Snikket interface, Ruby creates a 'Game Night'
circle, and sends an invitation link with her friends.

## Default circle

Every Snikket instance is created with a default circle. The circle's name
defaults to the domain name of the instance.

## Circle group chats

Every circle has a group chat automatically created and managed by Snikket.
This provides a shared space where members of a circle can exchanged messages
and files with each other.

Note that membership of this group chat is linked directly to circle membership,
therefore it is not possible to directly manage the members or invite new
users to the chat via the app. This restriction only applies to the automatic
group chat created by Snikket. You can use the app to create and manage as
many additional group chats as you need.

## Contact list synchronization

Snikket will automatically synchronize the circle members' contact lists, so
that every member can find every other member in their Snikket contacts for
direct one-to-one messaging.
